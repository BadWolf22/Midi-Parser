# Midi-Parser

## Why?
It has always been somewhat of a black box to me how custom files are handled. Of course, I knew the generals, but I wanted to know more.

Therefore, I have decided to implement a vanilla frontent JavaScript MIDI parser.

## Functionality
This is simply meant to be a MIDI parsing script for use on the client's side. It will parse the MIDI file into a class that can easily have information extracted from in a familiar JS way. 

This is currently a stepping stone. The script itself will be of little use without another script to utilize the parsed data. I intend to use this in a following project soon.
